  bio: "I am a software developer with 20 years of experience. Over this time I’ve worked with languages such as Delphi (yes, I’m old), Ruby, .NET, NodeJS and Java. I’ve also done my share of people management and found that really wasn’t for me. Writing and designing software is my true calling. I was lucky enough to have great mentors early on in my career and these days, sharing my passion and hopefully inspiring the next generation of developers is one of the top goals."
