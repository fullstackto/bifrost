  title: "Homicide Detective"
  bio: "As a Homicide Detective and Hostage Negotiator, Stacey not only uses ACTIVE LISTENING SKILLS (ALS) in situations of crisis involving expressive individuals, he also uses the skills to help resolve everyday life and business situations.

This presentation will allow businesses to use the TEAM PROJECT MODEL to help their team members cooperate with each other, with the focus on utilizing distinctive intensities within individual elements among members of a team.

Stacey’s presentation will illustrate that the above model is acceptable. However, a team will not communicate effectively if a team that has been taken apart and separated due to disconnection and lack of communication."

  company: "Intuit"
  title: "Principal Software Developer"
  bio: "I am a software developer with 20 years of experience. Over this time I’ve worked with languages such as Delphi (yes, I’m old), Ruby, .NET, NodeJS and Java. I’ve also done my share of people management and found that really wasn’t for me. Writing and designing software is my true calling. I was lucky enough to have great mentors early on in my career and these days, sharing my passion and hopefully inspiring the next generation of developers is one of the top goals."
